# Why-Civil-Resistance-Works
In terms of the course **Applied Machine Learning** under the supervision of [Panos Louridas](https://github.com/louridas), this repository contains analysis on whether peaceful or violent civil resistance campaigns are more effective in resolving social or political issues.

## Analysis

The assignment consists of **7 Sections**, which are explicitly stated in the [Assignment Description](https://github.com/nickosfra/Data-Analysis-on-Civil-Resistance-Data/blob/master/Assignment/wcrw.ipynb). Briefly, the project focuses on:
- creating data visualizations that show the frequency of violent and non-violent campaigns
- calculating the success rate of violent and non-violent campaigns
- examining the effect of participation on the probability of campaign success
- examining whether location affects the campaign's result

The analysis can be found [here](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Data-and-Replication-Files-3.zip)

## Dataset

The project uses findings of a well-received book, [Why Civil Resistance Works](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/research/wcrw) by [Erical Chenoweth](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/). The dataset contains records of campaigns from 1900 onwards, and can be downloaded from [here](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Data-and-Replication-Files-3.zip).
